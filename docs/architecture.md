# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator follows a microservices architecture designed for high availability and scalability. This document covers both production and development configurations.

## Components

### 1. Application Server
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express
- **Production Port**: 8080
- **Development Port**: 3000
- **Scaling**: Horizontal auto-scaling (production only)
- **Development Features**: Hot reload, debug mode

### 2. Database Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14
- **Production**: Master-slave replication with automated backups and TLS
- **Development**: Single local instance with seed data and relaxed security

### 3. Monitoring System
- **Production**: Prometheus + Grafana with email alerts and paging
- **Development**: Console logging with verbose output
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network

## Deployment Strategy

### Production
- **Method**: Rolling updates or Kubernetes deployments
- **Zero-downtime**: Yes (readiness/liveness checks)
- **Rollback**: Automated on failure
- **Region**: us-east-1

### Development
- **Method**: Docker Compose for quick local testing
- **Features**: Hot reload, instant feedback
- **Testing**: Automated tests run locally before deploy

## Security
- **Production**: SSL/TLS encryption, strict access controls, secrets management
- **Development**: Relaxed security for rapid iteration (do not use production secrets)

## Notes
Experimental features are available in development builds and must be feature-flagged before being promoted to production.
